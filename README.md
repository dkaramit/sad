At the moment I am redesigning the code. Look at other branches to get the general idea. 

## To-do:
- [ ] IMPORTANT:*Variables should not hold values. The `evaluate` function should take numbers as inputs for the variables*. 
- [ ] Implement as many functions as possible.
- [ ] Output to ![sadET](https://github.com/dkaramit/sadET). This will be useful because `sadET` is faster, since it uses expression templates.
- [ ] Documentation.
